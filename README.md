# Genome exploration

- [Enriched Motif Search (C. elegans, Mouse, Killifish)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/iron-lion/colab-yPark/blob/main/notebooks/promoter_k_mer.ipynb)
Motifs are identified, counted, and listed based on their frequency in the promoters of the input gene set.

# Fluorescent microscopy image process

- [C. elegans Head signal counter](https://colab.research.google.com/github/iron-lion/colab-yPark/blob/main/notebooks/worm_head_signal_detect.ipynb)
Segment head part of Worm and calculate peaks of fluorescent signals.

- [C. elegans segmentation and signal counter](https://colab.research.google.com/github/iron-lion/colab-yPark/blob/main/notebooks/micro_sam_worm_body_signal_detect.ipynb)
Segment the entire body of the worm (or cells) and calculate peaks of fluorescent signals.
